# RS-LLaVA BigEarthNet VQA

A reproducible pipeline for turning BigEarthNet patch labels into single-image VQA conversations and fine-tuning an LLaVA-compatible model with QLoRA.

## Setup

Use a CUDA-enabled environment for practical training. On Windows, install a CUDA-compatible PyTorch wheel first, then install this package. Use the same interpreter for both commands:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

`bitsandbytes` is commonly easiest on Linux/WSL. The training command fails early with a clear message if 4-bit loading is unavailable.

## 1. Build VQA records

Prepare a manifest as JSONL or CSV with `image` and `labels` fields. `labels` can be a JSON list or a semicolon/comma-separated string.

```json
{"image":"/data/BigEarthNet-S2_0001.jpg","labels":["Broad-leaved forest","Water bodies"]}
```

Then generate two records per patch:

```powershell
python -m rs_llava_ben.prepare_data --input manifest.jsonl --output data/ben_vqa.jsonl
```

The generated records contain the exact requested questions, an image path, normalized labels, and a `task` field (`multilabel` or `presence`).

## 2. Fine-tune

The default base model is `liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b`; pass an RS-adapted LLaVA-compatible model with `--model-name` when available.

```powershell
python -m rs_llava_ben.train `
  --data data/ben_vqa.jsonl `
  --output-dir checkpoints/rs-llava-bigearthnet `
  --model-name liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b `
  --epochs 3
```

QLoRA settings are fixed to rank 16 and alpha 32 by default. Images are read from the `image` field; no image bytes are embedded in the JSONL.

## 3. Evaluate OA and AA

For a prediction JSONL containing `true_labels` and `pred_labels` lists:

```powershell
python -m rs_llava_ben.evaluate --predictions predictions.jsonl --output metrics.json
```

`overall_accuracy` is exact multilabel-set accuracy. `average_accuracy` is macro per-class accuracy, computed over the union of labels. The evaluator also reports presence-question accuracy when those fields are supplied.

## 4. Inference output

```powershell
python -m rs_llava_ben.infer `
  --adapter checkpoints/rs-llava-bigearthnet `
  --image /data/example.jpg `
  --question "What land cover types are present in this satellite image?"
```

The command prints:

```json
{"answer":"...","confidence":0.87,"model":"RS-LLaVA-BigEarthNet","task":"vqa"}
```

Confidence is a reproducible heuristic based on generated token scores, not a calibrated probability.

## VQA API

The FastAPI service exposes `POST /api/v1/vqa` with JSON input:

```json
{"image_b64":"<base64 JPEG, PNG, or GeoTIFF>","question":"What land cover types are present?","top_k":1}
```

Start it with:

```powershell
python -m rs_llava_ben.api
```

The endpoint converts accepted images to RGB, rejects payloads over 10MB with `400`, applies a 30-second inference timeout, and writes every request to `audit_log.sqlite3`. `create_app(backend=..., audit_log=...)` is the injection point for a loaded RS-LLaVA backend; the backend returns `BackendResult` so the API can include the answer, confidence, model name, and optional evidence bounding boxes.

# 🛰️ SatQuery AI

### Agentic Natural-Language Assistant for Remote Sensing & Satellite Imagery

SatQuery AI is an **agentic AI-powered remote-sensing assistant** that allows users to interact with satellite imagery using natural-language queries.

Instead of requiring users to understand GIS tools, satellite bands, remote-sensing workflows, or machine-learning models, SatQuery AI interprets the user's question, determines the appropriate task, selects the required AI/vision models, analyzes the uploaded imagery, and returns an understandable result.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Remote-sensing data is widely used in:

- 🌾 Agriculture
- 🌊 Water-resource monitoring
- 🌳 Forest monitoring
- 🏙️ Urban planning
- 🔥 Disaster management
- 🛣️ Infrastructure monitoring
- 🌍 Environmental analysis

However, existing remote-sensing workflows often require users to have knowledge of:

- Satellite imagery
- GIS software
- Image-processing techniques
- Remote-sensing indices
- Machine-learning models
- Model parameters and configurations

This creates a significant barrier for non-expert users.

### Our Solution

**SatQuery AI converts natural-language questions into remote-sensing analysis workflows.**

For example:

> "Which areas in this image show possible vegetation stress?"

Instead of manually selecting datasets, preprocessing imagery, choosing models, and interpreting outputs, the agent determines an appropriate analysis workflow and provides the result.

---

# 🎯 Key Features

## 🤖 Agentic AI

SatQuery AI uses an agent-based architecture to:

1. Understand the user's natural-language query
2. Classify the requested task
3. Select appropriate tools/models
4. Analyze the satellite image
5. Generate a natural-language explanation
6. Provide confidence and execution information

---

## 🛰️ Satellite Image Analysis

Users can upload supported remote-sensing imagery for analysis.

Supported image formats include:

- TIFF
- PNG
- JPEG

Uploaded files are securely validated before being passed to the AI pipeline.

---

## 💬 Natural-Language Queries

Users can ask questions such as:

```text
"What type of land cover is visible in this image?"

"Which areas appear to be urbanized?"

"Is there evidence of vegetation stress?"

"Identify possible water bodies."

"What changed between these two images?"
